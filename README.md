Programs I worked on while doing Carnegie Mellon University's python course [CS Academy- College Programming and Computer Science]:

A description of the course -

A full-year honors-level course in programming and computer science, College Programming and Computer Science prepares students for college studies in computer science and related disciplines. This course re-examines earlier topics (functions, conditionals, loops, strings, lists, and more) in greater detail and increased rigor.
The course also covers top-down design, style, intermediate data structures (sets, dictionaries), recursion, object-oriented programming, and efficiency, among other topics.
